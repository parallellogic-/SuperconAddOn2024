bug in RGB display was in the set_hue_max method - was dividing by too much and losing the fractional brightness of the target led, so only get 2-bit color in defcon badge
nixed the precision millis() function and dropped TIM2 into 16-bit timer functionality

*put yes/no/immedaite on gray/green/rey arrows in flow diagram
star=start entry to diagram

define what acryonms mean

Note that Arduino and STM8 disagree on addresses accroding to chatGPT and verified in HW
Arduino is sending on 0x30 and STM receives on 0x18.  oscope reads as 0x30

Make sure the STM8 is using the correct I2C address. The Arduino sends 0x30, which corresponds to 0x18 (since the last bit is used to indicate read/write in I2C).

    Shift Address: Some I2C libraries require you to shift the 7-bit address left by 1 bit when setting it up. For example, the STM8's I2C peripheral might expect 0x18 as the slave address, which is 0x30 when shifted left and combined with the R/W bit.

TODO: watchdog

-- 10/14/24

surprised how small it is - could have made larger for free (min size with rails is 70mm square for full color silk screen)
white silkscreen avoce artwork on front (wasn't planned, presumably needed for part placement?)
cautious to break off mouse bites
would have been better to laser cut a sample to check the scale
barely plugged vias, minuscule light through vias, 100 mil header is clean
rgb sillkscreen extendsd under parts - silkscreen is done before part reflow
hard to test uart/i2c with current programmer configuration (without de-solder/re-soldering header multiple times)
***yellow color on RGB looks dirty...

- Kinda surprised how small they are.  They're the size I designed them to be, I just never made a mock-up to get an idea of the dimensions
- They left a bit of while silkscreen around each part, which irks me a bit, I know I didn't have that in the design files (if I did, it would have come out as black).  I suspect that's a technical limitation of whatever process they use (can only get color so close to the pads or something)
- Buttons and LEDs work, no issue

***refactor debug led coming on when all others are off

users think the colored gems are rockets

*need a diagram illustrating what I did (design/layout) vs others (art, fab, delivery) - illustrative cartoons to show what each stage looks like
